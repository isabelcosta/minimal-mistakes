# about me

I'm a software developer from Portugal. This summer I was a [Google Summer of Code](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com) Student with [Systers Community](https://github.com/systers). I proposed [Mentorship System](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/projects/#5331289322815488), which I started implementing the [backend](https://github.com/systers/mentorship-backend) and [android application](https://github.com/systers/mentorship-android) during the program.

I was an Android Developer at [Innovation Makers](https://inm.pt/) for two years and in summer of 2015, I was a Software Engineering intern at [Uniplaces](https://uniplaces.com/).

I also graduated recently from Masters degree of Telecommunication and Informatics Engineering at [TÃ©cnico Lisboa](https://tecnico.ulisboa.pt/) and I developed my thesis ["Private Reactive Multipath Communication Middleware"](https://github.com/inesc-id/Premium) at [INESC-ID](https://www.inesc-id.pt/).

You can learn more about my work experience on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/isabelcmdcosta) and some projects I work with at [GitHub](https://github.com/isabelcosta).
