After participating on [Google Summer of Code](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com) with [Systers Community](https://anitab.org/systers/) I started to really like Open Source.

I was an Android Developer at [Innovation Makers](https://inm.pt/) and pursuing a master’s degree in Telecommunications and Informatics Engineering at [Técnico Lisboa](https://tecnico.ulisboa.pt/). In summer of 2015, I was a Software Engineering intern at [Uniplaces](https://uniplaces.com/).
