After participating on [Google Summer of Code](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com) with [Systers Community](https://anitab.org/systers/) I started to really like Open Source.

I was an Android Developer at [Innovation Makers](https://inm.pt/).

In summer of 2015, I was a Software Engineering intern at [Uniplaces](https://uniplaces.com/).

I graduated recently from Masters degree of Telecommunication and Informatics Engineering at [Técnico Lisboa](https://tecnico.ulisboa.pt/). I developed my Master's thesis "Private Reactive Multipath Communication Middleware" at [INESC-ID](https://www.inesc-id.pt/).
